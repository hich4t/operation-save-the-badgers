# Why
By September 30th, 2025, Roblox intend to close all unrated games in Roblox to further enforce their moderation on safety issues (which is very much hot news lately). This includes the implementation of [Content Maturity and Compliance](https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/promotion/content-maturity) system where creators may fill out a questionnaire in their own Roblox game's dashboard to earn a maturity rating in their game.

Due to Roblox's intention to close all unrated games by September 30th, 2025, it also brought up significant issues regarding the badge collecting community where **older classic games may also be closed due to many older owners not being active anymore or terminated**. This endangered more than 50% of all legacy badges where they are mostly from games with inactive or terminated owners who cannot fill in the questionnaire.
Luckily, Roblox saw this issue and posted [an official statement](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/important-updates-unrated-experiences-and-changes-to-experience-pages/3899317) regarding preserving classic games. They stated that games with at least 1,000 lifetime visits are possible to not be closed along with other factors such as recent visits, engagement, and favorites count. With this statement, there is a much bigger hope for the existing badge collecting community (especially those who focus on collecting legacy badges) to keep existing. 
Thus, **Operation: Save the Badgers** is created, where badge collectors will try to help each other to preserve any legacy badge games with less than 1,000 visits to reach that goal. This operation will be carried out until September 30th, 2025, and until then, we hope every active badge collectors are able to help with this operation and help us preserve legacy badge games for future collectors to collect!
